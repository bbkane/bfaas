## Dependencies

- [makeheaders](http://www.hwaci.com/sw/mkhdr/) (make sure it's in the path)
- CMake
- a C compiler

TODO:

- I need to figure out a way to use the same logic whether I'm dealing with stdin/stdout or with an input array and an output array.
- Make the HTTP server part (Python with sanic? Go?)
- Make CMakeLists cross platform with better options
